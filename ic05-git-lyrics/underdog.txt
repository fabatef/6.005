Underdog Raps
=============

	Kyle Massey

When criminals in this world appear,
And break the laws that they should fear,
And frighten all who see or hear,
The cry goes up both far and near for

Under, Under, dog
Under, Under, dog

That's the superhero bluff
Crooks and bandits give it up
There's no reason to be so mean
When these dogs have overseen

Send for rescue, here it comes
This canine is number one

[Chorus]

Under dog
Under dog
Under dog
Under dog

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder,
Fighting all who rob or plunder
Underdog, ooh Underdog.

When in this world the headlines read
Of those who's hearts are filled with greed
And rob and steal from those in need.
To right this wrong with blinding speed goes

Under, Under, dog
Under, Under, dog

Coming at you right on time
Saving lives and stopping crime
Don't you worry, he'll be there
So you bad guys you beware
To do wrong when he's around
Guess who's coming to your town

[Chorus]

Come on baby it's no wonder
Oh indeed he's my only number.
Put your hands way up high.
Who's that flying in the sky?
Under dog, ooh, under dog.
Yeah yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Anywhere everywhere do this superhero stare
Can you hear him
Feel the simmer
Fighting crime since I remember

Under, Under, dog
Under, Under, dog

He's the one that saves the day
Under dog is here to stay
To the rescue here he comes
This canine is number one.

Coming at your rght on time saving lifes and stopping crime.
There's no need to fear under dog un un under dog is here.

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's no need to fear under dog is here
Un un under dog is here.
Un un under dog is here
