Man or Muppet
=============

    Jason Segel, Walter

I reflect on my reflection
and I ask myself the question
What's the right direction to go
I don't know.

Am I a man or am I a muppet?

(Am I a muppet?)

If I'm a muppet then I'm a very manly muppet.

(a very manly muppet)

Am I a muppet

(muppet)

or am I a man?

(Am I a man?)

If I'm a man that makes me a muppet of a man.

(a muppet of a man)

I look into these eyes
and I don't recognize
The one I see inside.
It's time for me to decide:

Am I a man or am I a muppet?

(Am I a muppet?)

If I'm a muppet, well I'm a very manly muppet.

(a very manly muppet)

Am I a muppet

(muppet)

or am I a man?

(Am I a man?)

If I'm a man that makes me a muppet of a man.

(a muppet of a man)

Here I go again
I'm always running out of time
I think I've made up my mind
Now I understand, who I am:

I'm a Man!

I'm a Muppet!

I'm a muppet of a man!

I'm a very manly muppet!

I'm a Muppety Man!

That's what I am.
